# Introduction

Welcome to Thena's API documentation. Our API provides programmatic access to Thena's powerful features, allowing you to integrate AI agents, manage organizations, handle authentication, and more into your applications.

## Base URL

All API endpoints are accessible through the following base URL:

```bash
https://api.thena.ai/v1
```

## Authentication

All API requests must include an API key in the request headers. To authenticate your requests, include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

To obtain an API key, please contact our support team or visit your dashboard settings.

## Available Endpoints

Our API is organized around the following main categories:

### Agents
Manage and interact with AI agents, including creation, configuration, and communication endpoints.

### Authentication
Endpoints for user authentication, token management, and session handling.

### CRM
Customer relationship management features including contact and lead management.

### Health
System health and status check endpoints.

### Hubspot
Integration endpoints for Hubspot CRM synchronization.

### Integrations
Manage various third-party integrations and connections.

### Organizations
Endpoints for managing organizations, teams, and user permissions.

### Tools
Access and configure various tools and utilities available in the platform.

## Rate Limiting

Our API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage. Rate limits are applied on a per-API key basis. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses will have a 2xx status code, while errors will have 4xx or 5xx status codes.

Example success response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data
  }
}
```

Example error response:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "error_code",
    "message": "Error description"
  }
}
```

## Pagination

For endpoints that return lists of items, we use cursor-based pagination. Include `limit` and `cursor` parameters in your requests:

```bash
GET /v1/agents?limit=10&cursor=next_cursor_token
```
